# WordBank_EdStats

## Goal of the project

The goal here is to generate insights from educationnal statistics from the WordBank: [link to dataset](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search/dataset/00384800.

From the WordBank: "The World Bank EdStats All Indicator Query holds over 4,000 internationally comparable indicators that describe education access, progression, completion, literacy, teachers, population, and expenditures. The indicators cover the education cycle from pre-primary to vocational and tertiary education.The query also holds learning outcome data from international and regional learning assessments (e.g. PISA, TIMSS, PIRLS), equity data from household surveys, and projection/attainment data to 2050. For further information, please visit the EdStats website."
